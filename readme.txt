                          File Binder 
                             v1.0

What is it?
-----------
Basically this takes a bunch of files and puts them in one file, then it 
spits out a header file with defines to an index number.


Usage
-----
Well, you can do it the hard way on command line:
    
    fbind file1 file2 file3 file4

Put the above in a batch file if you care about order. Add in files as
needed. Run it. 

You can also just drag and drop several files onto the excutable in 
Windows explorer. 


Why did I make this?
--------------------
I was bored, and for some reason I'm facinated with file formats. I love
looking at files in a hex editor.

But I also kind of needed it for another project of mine.
